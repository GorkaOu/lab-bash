1. Using the echo command print in console "Hello World". Here is some info about echo command [https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-are-practical-uses-of-the-echo-command/394788] 
   echo "Hello World"

2. Create a new directory called `new_dir`.
    mkdir new_dir

3. Delete/Remove thermdir new_ directory `new_dir`.
    rmdir new_dir

4. Copy the file `sed.txt` from the `lorem` folder and paste it to the folder `lorem-copy` folder.
    cp lorem/sed.txt lorem-copy/

5. Copy the other two files from the `lorem folder` to `lorem-copy` folder in just one line using semicolon `;`.
    cp lorem/at.txt lorem-copy/ ; cp lorem/lorem.txt lorem-copy
    
6. Show the `sed.txt` file content from the `lorem` folder.
    cat sed.txtclear
    
7. Show the `at.txt` file and `lorem.txt` file contents from `lorem` folder.
     cat at.txt ; cat lorem.txtsed.txt
     
8. Print the first 3 rows in `sed.txt` file from lorem-copy folder.
    head -3 sed.txt
    
9. Print the last 3 rows in `sed.txt` file from lorem-copy folder.
    tail -3 sed.txt

10. Add "Homo homini lupus." at the end of `sed.txt` file in the `lorem-copy` folder.
    echo "Homo homini lupus" >> sed.txt

11. Print the last 3 rows in `sed.txt` file from `lorem-copy` folder. You should see `Homo homini lupus.`.
    tail -3 sed.txt
    nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae           consequatur,
    vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?Homo homini lupus
    Homo homini lupus

12. `sed` command is used to replace the text in a file. Use the `sed` command to replace all occurances of `et` with `ET` in the file `at.txt` file present in the folder `lorem`. You can use the following link to refer to `sed` commands [https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/manipulate-text-from-the-command-line-with-sed/]
Check the contents of the sed.txt file using `cat` command.
    sed 's/ET/et/' at.txt

13. Find who is the system user. 
    whoami
    gorka
    
14. Find the current path of the directory you are in.
    pwd
    /c/Users/gorka/IH-Labs/lab-bash/lorem-copy

15. List all files with the extension `.txt` in lorem folder.
   ls *.txt
   I take the information from this page : https://www.howtogeek.com/448446/how-to-use-the-ls-command-on-linux/

16. Count the rows in `sed.txt` file from lorem folder. Look concatenate `cat` and `wc` with the pipe `|`.
   cat sed.txt | wc -l
   I take the information from this page : https://itsfoss.com/es/comando-wc-linux/
   
17. Count the **files** which start with `lorem` in all directories.
   ls -f "lorem" | wc -l
   This is not working, but I expect to be near from the solution (;
